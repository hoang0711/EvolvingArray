# Project: Evolving Array

# Description: This array class object can implement the variable-sized capacity feature. It utilized a static array as its underlying data storage container.
#              It contains the following methods: append, resize, insert_at_index, remove_at_index, slice, merge, map and find_mode.
#              The resize method doubles the array's underlying storage once its capacity reaches maximum.
